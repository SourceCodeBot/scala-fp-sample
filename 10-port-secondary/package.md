# Secondary port

In the 'Secondary port' you will find only the declaration (interfaces) of classes/traits that have to be implemented. Here one finds only the abstract description, which must fulfill each implementation so.
It is not relevant whether the state is in the database at the end, or in memory. Only the domain objects of the "Core" module should be exchanged here as a dependency.

> Keep in mind, every interpretation is affected of changes in this module!
